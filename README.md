## About The Project
Aim Training is a project that allows users to train their muscle memory responsible for aiming. The app has few customization features, user can change size of the map and target, as well as change the time of game. Moreover, there are two gamemodes: classic and frenzy. The second one has three difficulty levels.
Again, I tested my strengths in React + TypeScript combination and learn a lot from it along developing this project.

When I was starting my front-end journey one year ago, the first thing I knew I wanted to do is... Aim Training website! I love first First-Person Shooters and I always thought having my own training app is a cool idea. Only recently I felt like I have enough skill to make it perfect and it is time to finally bulid it.
